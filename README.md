A try to get a bluetooth split keyboard

This keyboard is initially built with Swedish keyboard layout in mind,
however, it should be easy to insert which ever keyboard layout you
are comfortable with. This is a sketch of how my keyboard is designed
at the moment.

As many may notice, I have added a mouse pointer to the right hand
side of the keyboard. My philosophy is that you should not have to
move the hands more than necessary while using this keyboard, if you
want to ajust something with the mouse or scroll down or what not, you
should be able to do that with the thumb of your right hand. However,
this is just an initial test for it and it might not end up in the
final revision of this keyboard.

Also, to start with this keyboard will not run bluetooth. Only when I
am confident with the design and everything on this keyboard will I
add the bluetooth feature (Which might take some time).
